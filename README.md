The lack of affordable programming lessons in today's society inspired us to jumpstart Tech4u. The high costs associated with programming lessons often fuel the disparities faced by historically underrepresented groups in the programming sector. As a first-hand observer of these sectional disparities, we aim to make programming accesible for each and every single person.
