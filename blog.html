    <h2>How it all started:</h2>
      <p> The lack of affordable programming lessons in today's society inspired us to jumpstart Tech4u. The high costs associated with programming lessons often fuel the disparities faced by historically underrepresented groups in the programming sector. As a first-hand observer of these sectional disparities, we aim to make programming accesible for each and every single person.
  </p>
      <h2>What we have done?
  </h2>
  <p>In order to promote STEM education for all, Tech-4U has initiated a series of programs. For instance, during the summer of 2021, Tech4U has established 4 summer camps that aim to teach children Game Development, Python, Web Development, Java, and Machine Learning. Likewise, Tech4U has hosted a series of Java and Python summer camps in the past that introduced hundreds of children into programming. 
  </p>
    <h2>Future Plans:</h2><p>During August 2021, Tech4U plans to host an international hackathon with several hundred participants around the world. We also to aim to expand our fundraising program to raise significantly more money through donations and fundraisers. Likewise, the current tech4u blog and podcast program is not as large as we would like it to be. Therefore, we plan to start a youtube channel with quality technology content.  </p>
